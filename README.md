# Industrial-inventory-tracking-
This project introduces a smart industrial solution that integrates a scanner and weighing machine to automatically extract and print box credentials. It logs every scanned entry with a timestamp and provides a searchable database of all past entries.

**Industrial inventory tracking ** is an industrial automation application that connects a scanner, weight machine, printer, and computer system into a seamless workflow. Once a box is scanned, its data is fetched and weight measured. A printed label is generated with all the box credentials. Additionally, the software records each entry with a timestamp for later review.
